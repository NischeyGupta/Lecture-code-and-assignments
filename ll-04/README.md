This sign-in assignment is all about implementing Iterable and Iterator. The data structure used here is a [Depth-First Search Tree](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/dfs). The rules are quite simple: return the next left-most child. If there are no more children in this branch of the tree, get the next left-most child from the parent. 

A suggestion: you don't need to know how the entire data structure works to make these tests pass. All you need to know are the conditions for `hasNext()` and `next()`. You can track the position of current/next in the Iterator.

As usual, full marks for passing all tests.

This is a medium-complicated iterator example. Along with the two simple iterators we saw last week, it will give you an example of how to practice for the midterm. The best practice is to set challenges for yourself by defining your own data structures and seeing what it would mean to iterate through them.
